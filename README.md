Nohoch is a CLI tool that can be used to identify who has the most knowledge about a given file. It's often not the most recent person to commit changes to a file, but rather the person who has added or delted the most lines over the lifetime of the file.

```bash
gem info -r nohoch
gem install nohoch
```
